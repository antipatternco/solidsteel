The original Spacek trio music dates from 2001 and still sounds fresh and futuristic today, and his collaborations with the likes of Mark Pritchard and J Dilla, alongside his myriad solo productions under various monikers have been consistently and singularly brilliant. Kutmah (Sketchbook / IZWID) is one of our favourite selectors and DJs. His insatiable appetite for new music and his knowledge and passion for heritage sounds, teamed with the fact that he\\'s a huge fan of Steve\\'s music over the years made him the perfect candidate to do this mix. So here it is...Beat Spacek x Kutmah: Classics, collabs \u0026 unreleased heat from Steve Spacek\\'s epic catalogue selected \u0026 mixed by Kutmah.\r\n\r\nIn Hour 2 this week we kick off a new regular feature for Solid Steel - Record Store Residency. Launching off the back of our successful RSD 2014 special, each month we\\'ll be asking some of the best record shops from around the world to contribute a 60 minute mix, showcasing the music they love. First up it\\'s Drift Record Shop from Devon in the UK, who deliver us a mix and told us \\\"The shop curation is pretty scatty, so to avoid too much of a discordant listen we focused primarily on drum machines, synths, pianos and organs.\\\" Music on offer from Oneohtrix Point Never, Romare, Martyn, Radiohead, Four Tet and The Gaslamp Killer for your Friday afternoon listening pleasure.","link1":"\u003ciframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188506330\u0026color=ff5500\u0026auto_play=false\u0026hide_related=false\u0026show_comments=true\u0026show_user=true\u0026show_reposts=false\\\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","link2":"\u003ciframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188499886\u0026color=ff5500\u0026auto_play=false\u0026hide_related=false\u0026show_comments=true\u0026show_user=true\u0026show_reposts=false\\\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","link3":"","link4":"","created_at":"2015-03-16T11:30:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-06T15:19:03Z","image_file_name":null,"image_content_type":null,"image_file_size":null,"image_updated_at":null,"featured":true,"highlight":false,"background_image_file_name":null,"background_image_content_type":null,"background_image_file_size":null,"background_image_updated_at":null,"spreadsheet_file_name":null,"spreadsheet_content_type":null,"spreadsheet_file_size":null,"spreadsheet_updated_at":null}}
